## ðŸ“‹ Description

- A simple currency converter app with a Tkinter GUI.
- Asks the user to enter an amount.
- Then it asks which currency to convert to (e.g., USD to EUR).

- Finally, it prints the converted amount in the terminal.
- This is a sample project; it has no commercial purpose. I'm also working on other projects.
